# What Is Node.js and What Is It Used For?

## Introduction

**Node.js** is a **C++ based command-line (CLI) application** that allows developers to **run JavaScript code outside the browser**.

It provides a **runtime environment** built on **Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine**, enabling JavaScript to be used on the **server side**.

Before Node.js, JavaScript was mainly used only in browsers.  
Node.js made JavaScript a **full-stack language**.

## What Is Node.js?

### Definition  
Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime environment** that executes JavaScript code on the server instead of the browser.

### Key Points
- Built using **C++**
- Uses **Chrome V8 Engine**
- Runs JavaScript **outside the browser**
- Works via **command line (CLI)**
- Event-driven and non-blocking

---

## Why Node.js Exists

Browsers restrict JavaScript for security reasons.  
Node.js removes those limitations and allows JavaScript to:
- Access files
- Create servers
- Handle network requests
- Work with databases

## What Is Node.js Used For?

### 1. Web Servers & APIs
- Creating fast and scalable backend servers
- REST APIs and real-time applications
- Used with frameworks like **Express.js**

### 2. Command Line Tools
Node.js powers many popular developer tools, such as:
- NPM
- TypeScript
- Webpack
- ESLint
- Babel
- Yarn
- Create React App
- Vue CLI
- Angular CLI
- Prettier

### 3. Internet of Things (IoT)
- Lightweight and efficient
- Handles multiple device connections
- Used in real-time IoT systems

## Where Node.js Is Commonly Used

- Backend development
- Real-time applications (chat apps, notifications)
- Microservices
- Dev tools and build systems
- Automation scripts

## Conclusion

Node.js allows developers to use **JavaScript everywhere**—both on the frontend and backend.  
Its speed, scalability, and huge ecosystem make it one of the most popular backend technologies today.
