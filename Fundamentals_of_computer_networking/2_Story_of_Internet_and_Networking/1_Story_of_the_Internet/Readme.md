# 🌐 History of the Internet – ARPANET

This README explains how the Internet was developed, starting from the Cold War era and the creation of ARPANET.

---

## 📜 Background

* In the early days, when there was **no Internet**, data was transferred **physically** using paper, magnetic tapes, or disks.
* During the **Cold War**, a technological competition began between the **USA and the USSR**.
* In **1957**, the USSR launched the world’s first artificial satellite, **Sputnik**, which alarmed the USA.

---

## 🚀 Formation of ARPA

* In response, the **US government established ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency)** in **1958** to promote advanced scientific research.
* Later, ARPA was renamed **DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)**.

---

## 🏫 Universities Involved in ARPANET

ARPA funded four major institutions to work on networking research:

* **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)**
* **Stanford Research Institute (SRI)**
* **University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)**
* **University of Utah**

These institutions needed an efficient way to **share research data**.

---

## ☎️ The Problem

* Communication was done using **telephone calls and written notes**, which was slow and inefficient.
* Researchers needed a **faster and automated method** to exchange data.

---

## 🔌 Birth of Computer Networking

* The idea was to **send data through cables**, similar to telephone lines.
* Since computers store data as **binary (0s and 1s)**, data was transmitted as **electrical signals**.
* In **1969**, the first computers were connected using telephone cables.
* A protocol called **NCP (Network Control Protocol)** was developed to manage communication.

---

## 💻 First Internet Message

* The first message sent from **UCLA to SRI** was **"LOGIN"**.
* The system crashed after sending only **"LO"**.
* This event is considered the **birth of the Internet**.

---

## 🌐 ARPANET

* After success, all four universities were connected.
* This network was limited to ARPA, so it is called an **Intranet**.
* Since ARPA developed it, the network was named **ARPANET**.
* The network speed was **50 kbps**, which was very fast at that time.

---

## 🔗 Evolution into the Internet

* Later, many organizations created their own networks.
* To allow **communication between different networks**, a standard protocol was required.
* In the **1980s**, **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)** was developed.

### Other Important Protocols

* **SMTP** – Email communication
* **FTP** – File transfer
* **HTTP** – Web communication

---

## 🌍 Global Internet

* Countries around the world were eventually connected using **undersea fiber-optic cables**.
* This led to the creation of the **global Internet** that we use today.

---

## ✅ Summary

* ARPANET was the **first computer network**.
* TCP/IP made the **modern Internet possible**.
* The Internet evolved from a **military research project** into a **global communication system**.
