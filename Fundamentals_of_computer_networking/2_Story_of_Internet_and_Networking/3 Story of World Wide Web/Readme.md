## 🧠 Tim Berners-Lee’s Vision (1989)

- In **1989**, a scientist named **Tim Berners-Lee** was working at **CERN Research Institute**, Switzerland.
- He thought of creating a technology where:
  - Information could be accessed
  - With just **one click**
  - Without manually entering IP addresses

## 🧩 Three Major Inventions by Tim Berners-Lee

To achieve this vision, he created three foundational technologies:
