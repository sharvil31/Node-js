Understanding OSI Model

To run networking efficiently and to divide work in different tasks, OSI model is made. OSI Model stands for Open Systems Interconnected Model. 
There are many works in Networking. IN OSI Model, these works are divided in 7 layers - 

7. Application Layer
6. Presentation Layer
5. Session Layer
4. Transport Layer
3. Network Layer
2. Data Link Layer
1. Physical Layer

It is not strictly neccessary that every device should follow these rules. It is just a general guideline.


7. Application Layer - Application layer acts as an interface between user and network. It presents data to the user in human readable form. It provides network services to applications.

6. Presentation Layer - In this layer many operations get performed on data like serialization, compression, encryption, translation etc. so that two systems can correctly understand eachother.

5. Session Layer - Session Layer helps to create a connection between two devices. There are no operations performed on data in this layer.

4. Transport Layer - In this layer data get divided into different segments. A number get added to each segment called port. Port identifies which request coming from which port.
